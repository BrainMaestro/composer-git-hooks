> Manage git hooks easily in your composer configuration. This command line tool makes it easy to implement a consistent project-wide usage of git hooks. Specifying hooks in the composer file makes them available for every member of the project team. This provides a consistent environment and behavior for everyone which is great. It is also possible to use to manage git hooks globally for every repository on your computer. That way you have a reliable set of hooks crafted by yourself for every project you choose to work on.

## Install

Add a `hooks` section to the `extra` section of your `composer.json` and add the hooks there. The previous way of adding hooks to the `scripts` section of your `composer.json` is still supported, but this way is cleaner if you have many scripts.

```javascript
{
    "extra": {
        "hooks": {
            "pre-commit": [
                "echo committing as $(git config user.name)",
                "php-cs-fixer fix ." // fix style
            ],
            // verify commit message. ex: ABC-123: Fix everything
            "commit-msg": "grep -q '[A-Z]+-[0-9]+.*' $1",
            "pre-push": [
                "php-cs-fixer fix --dry-run .", // check style
                "phpunit"
            ],
            "post-merge": "composer update",
            "...": "..."
        }
    }
}
```

Then install with

```sh
composer require --dev brainmaestro/composer-git-hooks
```

This installs the `cghooks` binary to your `vendor/bin` folder. If this folder is not in your path, you will need to preface every command with `vendor/bin/`.

### Global support

You can also install it globally. This feels much more natural when `cghooks` is used with the newly added support for managing global git hooks.

```sh
composer global require --dev brainmaestro/composer-git-hooks
```

All commands have global support (besides testing the hooks. Still requires being in the directory with the `composer.json` file).

### Optional Configuration

#### Shortcut

Add a `cghooks` script to the `scripts` section of your `composer.json` file. That way, commands can be run with `composer cghooks ${command}`. This is ideal if you would rather not edit your system path.

```json
{
    "scripts": {
        "cghooks": "vendor/bin/cghooks",
        "...": "..."
    }
}
```

#### Composer Events

Add the following events to your `composer.json` file.
The `cghooks` commands will be run every time the events occur.
By default `cghooks` will honor composer `--no-dev` option and will not setup hooks if `composer` is running in dev mode.
If you need to override this, use `--always` option.
Go to [Composer Command Events][link-composer-events] for more details about composer's event system.

```json
{
    "scripts": {
        "post-install-cmd": "cghooks add --ignore-lock",
        "post-update-cmd": "cghooks update",
        "...": "..."
    }
}
```

## Usage

All the following commands have to be run either in the same folder as your `composer.json` file or by specifying the `--git-dir` option to point to a folder with a `composer.json` file.

### Adding Hooks

After installation is complete, run `cghooks add`
to add all the valid git hooks that have been specified in the composer config.

| Option        | Description                      | Command                     |
| ------------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `no-lock`     | Do not create a lock file        | `cghooks add --no-lock`     |
| `ignore-lock` | Add the lock file to .gitignore  | `cghooks add --ignore-lock` |
| `force-win`   | Force windows bash compatibility | `cghooks add --force-win`   |

The `lock` file contains a list of all added hooks.

If the `--global` flag is used, the hooks will be added globally, and the global git config will also be modified. If no directory is provided, there is a fallback to the current `core.hooksPath` in the global config. If that value is not set, it defaults to `$COMPOSER_HOME` (this specific fallback only happens for the `add` command). It will fail with an error if there is still no path after the fallbacks.

### Updating Hooks

The update command which is run with `cghooks update` basically ignores the lock file and tries to add hooks from the composer lock. This is similar to what the `--force` option for the `add` command did. This command is useful if the hooks in the `composer.json` file have changed since the first time the hooks were added.

This works similarly when used with `--global` except that there is no fallback to `$COMPOSER_HOME` if no directory is provided.

### Removing Hooks

Hooks can be easily removed with `cghooks remove`. This will remove all the hooks that were specified in the composer config.

Hooks can also be removed by passing them as arguments. The command `cghooks remove pre-commit post-commit` which will remove the `pre-commit` and `post-commit` hooks.

| Option  | Description                                 | Command                  |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `force` | Delete hooks without checking the lock file | `cghooks remove --force` |

**CAREFUL**: If the lock file was tampered with or the force option was used, hooks that already existed before using this package, but were specified in the composer scripts config will be removed as well. That is, if you had a previous `pre-commit` hook, but your current composer config also has a `pre-commit` hook, this option will cause the command to remove your initial hook.

This also does not have a fallback to `$COMPOSER_HOME` if no directory is provided when used with `--global`.

### Listing hooks

Hooks can be listed with the `cghooks list-hooks` command. This basically checks composer config and list the hooks that actually have files.

#### Common Options

The following options are common to all commands.

| Option    | Description                         | Command                                        |
| --------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `git-dir` | Path to git directory               | `cghooks ${command} --git-dir='/path/to/.git'` |
| `global`  | Runs the specified command globally | `cghooks ${command} --global`                  |

Each command also has a flag `-v` to control verbosity for more detailed logs. Currently, only one level is supported.

### Testing Hooks

Hooks can be tested with `cghooks ${hook}` before adding them. Example `cghooks pre-commit` runs the `pre-commit` hook.
